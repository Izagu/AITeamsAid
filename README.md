## Additional Information
To replicate this, you will have to create an OpenAI account and pay for your use to utilize the API. I am using a .venv in VS code and have provided all of the libraries and software I am using for this project in the .txt file called "requirements". "Info.txt" also contains information of what items I ran in my terminal to set up my enviornment. I was not focused on the html for this project so it is very simple and actually be generated using ChatGPT with minor tweeks here and there.
