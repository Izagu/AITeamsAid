-  I ran pip freeze > requirements.txt so someone else can see what libraries and applications I used for this project
-  To put it simply I ran the following in terminal in VS code:
    #pip install openai
    #pip install Flask
    #API key was set to enviornment using the command setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your_api_key" in the terminal (powershell)
